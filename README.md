### The Process

#### Day 1

After being told the previous night to research different free APIs, I tested some endpoints on Postman to see what json data was returned. The following morning I was grouped with two colleagues and we began testing the Dog-API endpoints. We decide that an encyclopedia of dogs would be a fun project we all had an interest in. We dedicated the morning to whiteboarding and planning the website (pictured).

We continued to work as a team to get the basic functionality and aesthetic up and running. That evening I added some wallpaper to improve the look and feel of the site

#### Day 2

On day 2 we had a website which returned a list of dogs which could be clicked to display more detailed information about each breed. I was tasked with building a search bar at the top of the page. I had difficulty returning the correct data, however I found a different endpoint which allowed search by breed. I made a function which would filter through the breeds using an on change event listener. I had a problem in a previous homework where id didnâ€™t really work and wanted the chance to rectify it. The solution to this was to use the .toLowerCase method on both the input and dog map function.
